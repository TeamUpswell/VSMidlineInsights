# Key quotes from papers
LITERATURE_QUOTES = {
    "education": "While education generally correlates with health literacy, our findings suggest a more nuanced relationship with HPV vaccination acceptance in Nigeria.",
    "exposure": "Exposure to HPV vaccine messaging was the strongest predictor of vaccination, with an odds ratio of 3.7 (95% CI: 2.8-4.9).",
    "motivation": "Perceived importance of vaccination was strongly associated with uptake (p<0.001), but only when combined with high capability factors.",
    "ability": "Knowledge of where to access the vaccine was necessary but not sufficient for vaccination; motivational factors were also required.",

    "comb": "The COM-B framework explained 68% of the variance in vaccination behavior, with capability factors showing the strongest individual effect.",
    "barriers": "Limited knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer, misconceptions about vaccine safety, cultural concerns, and accessibility issues were identified as major barriers to vaccination.",
    "strategies": "Integration of HPV education into school curricula, community-based educational programs, and mobile vaccination clinics showed promising results for improving vaccination rates."
